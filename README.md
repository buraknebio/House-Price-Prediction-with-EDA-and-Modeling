# House Price Prediction with EDA and Modeling

## Overview

This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques and making practice about EDA. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The dataset used for this project is the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) retrieved from Kaggle.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: In this section, we import libraries, explore the data, select relevant features, and handle missing data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The EDA section includes univariate and bivariate analysis. Univariate analysis examines the distribution of each feature, while bivariate analysis explores the relationships between features and the target variable.

3. **Feature Engineering**: This part deals with categorical data, including one-hot encoding and target encoding.

4. **Model Building**: The project involves training several regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression, Support Vector Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, and Explained Variance Score.

## Model Comparison

The performance of various regression models is compared in the project. Among these models, XGBoost demonstrated the best performance, followed by Gradient Boosting and Random Forest Regression. The models are evaluated based on MSE, MAE, RMSE, R-squared, and Explained Variance Score metrics.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the entire data science pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It's a valuable exercise for understanding how to work with real-world datasets and apply machine learning techniques to solve regression problems.
